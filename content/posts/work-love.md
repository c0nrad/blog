This post is probably obvious for most people (not to mention it's super cliche). But it's something I've struggled to internalize.

(And before I get attacked, I'd like to preface that this is a very privileged post, yes).

There's really no sense in doing something if you don't love the process. I can't remember where I read it, but something about the answers to your decisions should either be "fuck yes, or no".

There's a million opportunities in front of everyone. From getting jobs, mastering a new skill, starting a business, writing a book. And with sufficient motivation, you can do any of them.

But they will fail if you're not sufficiently motivated, if it's not something you truly love doing. If you want to become a famous youtube streamer, great! I hope you love making content for 10years with no recognition. 

I think I've spent a bit of my life doing what I 'ought' to do. Which has been fine. But it did leave me a bit empty. I chased money and it left me in a career I didn't really enjoy. 

Another specific example, one of the hugest criterias' for a job for me is "how soon would I get promoted". "When would I be manager?", "can I expect a bigger team", "will this eventually lead me to CTO"?

But thinking about it more, is there no position where I'd be happy with no promotions? Where I'd enjoy going to work everyday just to do my standard job?

I think about starting little blogs, writing a book, learning a new skill (such as a martial art). 

Gandi said, "no matter what you do it will be insignificant, but it's very important that you do it".

I probably could do any of those things. And maybe I will one day.

Blog, I don't particularly love blogging. A post of mine his top of HN the other day, it wasn't that fun. It's weird being judged by people who most likely don't really do anything.
